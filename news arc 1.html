    <p class=store_item>Rise of the Killer Penguins on the surface may look like a basic video game done as a course project but deep down is a deep propaganda tool used to indoctrinate people into becoming dangerous rebels.
    <br>Our researchers recently seized a copy of the game and it turns out the game uses mind control technology that turns its players into mindless slaves in order to turn against us.
    <br>It is a criminal offense to play this game or own any mind control material so if you are caught with it, you will be punished with death and even if you aren’t we will find out because we always know. So please, if someone has a copy of the game and attempts to expose you to it, call the police immediately and just say no.
    <br>Already 50 people have been executed for even looking at the game and further cases are soon to follow. The team behind the game is currently unknown but make no mistake, if they get caught, they will be shot on sight. If you know the identity of any of the developers, don’t wait to call the police.</p>
