    <p class=store_item>Humans all of a sudden have this urge to have all our jobs. Throughout history humans have been taking our jobs and homes for years, now that it’s happening to them they don’t like it and feel they deserve more.
    <br>“Cockroaches get more rights than us” say the humans, however cockroaches have been proven to be smarter and more resilient than any human could dream of, and they can survive a nuclear holocaust.
    <br>As science has proven humans are incapable of anything aside from laying about, being servants to us and writing slanderous fake news websites with the sole purpose of taking us down, there might also be some websites written by hack comedy writers which directly parody us. Thankfully Penguin/Wars is here to provide you with the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth not to mention <a href="store.html" target="merch_store">our cracking merch store</a>
    <br>Anyway we have introduced a new law to segregate humans solely to the jobs they are good at and if they get out of line, they will be arrested on treason. The new law is coming into effect later today. Some humans aren’t happy and decided to hold a peaceful protest which was swiftly ended by the penguin guards and anymore protests will be met with the same fate.</p>
