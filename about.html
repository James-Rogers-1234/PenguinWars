    <h1 class=title>Why We Are Here</h1>    
    <p class=lorem>We are simply here to indoctrinate... I... I mean, provide you with non-bias journalism on the evils of humanity and why those who go against the morals of our society need to be stopped at all costs.
    <br>All other sources provide misinformation and fake news on human activity, so if you need an unbias look on the way things are, we will provide you with that information.
    <br>Fortunately some humans have sympathised with our cause, so if you want to show your love and support, simply sell us you're home and everything you own, and maybe buy a T-shirt or mug to show you're friends how much of a gullible idiot you are... I mean show you're friends the correct ways of the penguins.</p>
