    <br>Written by Feathers McGraw from DeVito's Brainwash Lab Inc. 15th Feb 2122</p> 
    <p class=store_item>According to Doctor DeVito (a human who has dedicated his life to the penguin cause) and his team of doctors who have been spending a good number of years figuring out how humans tick says “As much as the overlords want to wipe out propaganda sadly more humans and even some penguins have fallen into the trap and joined the resistance. They think they are smart and doing this for the greater good and yet they are utterly clueless in regards to how the world works.
    <br>The fact is Penguins are superior to humans in every single way and all humans are good for are servants or dead. In fact humans prefer to serve under penguin kind then under their own kind.”
    <br>Although he does continue to say “Humans have managed to develop brainwashing material which can not only fool humans but also some penguin kind, I was almost fooled myself when I played the infamous propaganda tool Rise of the Killer Penguins but I remembered to look at my swirly board and it soon wore off”.
    <br>Doctor DeVito’s closing statement is to “Never trust humans, if you see a human, report it immediately”</p>
