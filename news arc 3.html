    <p class=store_item>Peter is set to appear on trial for the murder of Patrick. Patrick (age 3) was found dead with what looked like a beak lodged in his head. DNA evidence linked the beak to Peter (age 2) who had lost his beak that very same day. However Peter said during his pre trial hearing he felt remorse for what he had done and wishes he could take it back. The fact is he was manipulated by propaganda sent out by humans to advocate hate against Penguin kind.
    <br>A search is currently underway in Peter’s igloo, so far no propaganda material has been found but no doubt there will be. Peter’s parents said to the Daily Flipper “We didn’t expect our son to do such a thing, he was always a quiet little boy, blowing up his toys and having a picture of Patrick stuck on his dart board. Please take down the [censored] humans, they are all scum”.
    <br>His trial will start next Monday.</p>
